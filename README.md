# Smart-Energy-Meter

##  OVERVIEW
    The primary goal of this project is to develop a smart energy meter that can track how much energy is used by solar installations. This smart energy meter will analyze power generation and consumption as well as provide added features like a smart billing system and high accuracy, making it more efficient than a standard energy meter. It can also be used to track your energy production by monitoring your solar power system. It can measure import units, export units, units generated, voltages, currents, power, power factor, frequency, and home usage. The cost of using grid and solar energy can also be estimated by the meter. As a result, the consumer will grasp their consumption costs clearly. The proposed project will have a friendly user interface for all consumers of different backgrounds. The smart energy meter will be generic means it can be used for both single-phase and three-phase supply. 
The smart energy meter will measure the data and then send it to Firebase, a Cloud platform by Google. Then the application will access all the data from the cloud and display it on a User interface.
